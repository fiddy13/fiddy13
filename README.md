I have experience and enjoy working with data. More specifically I enjoy building data pipelines, visualising data and 
working with stakeholders. I also enjoy solving problems, learning and co-creating. On a more personal note, I program for fun, read 
a lot and have played international rugby for Cyprus. You can find most of my projects on here. Feel free to contact me if you would 
like to contribute to any project or have any questions: fidias.efthymiou@gmail.com
